This is a repository where I will put various code written in JS. Out of other languages that I have tried that aren't python (the primary programming language I use these days). JS seems to be the only one I can see myself using. I feel concepts and stuff I learned in python help me learn and understand JS. Also HTML and CSS which I learned from creating my [[https://zortazert.codeberg.page][website]]. Maybe a little bit from simple scripts I made for [[https://codeberg.org/zortazert/GreaseMonkey-Redirect][GreaseMonkey-Redirect]].
