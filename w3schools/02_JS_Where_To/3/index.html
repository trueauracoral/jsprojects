<!-- Most of the time sourcing javascript code from a seperate file is better and more convenient. They list:
- It seperates HTML and code
- It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
- Chached JavaScript files can speed up loads -->

<!-- Like for example the img tag you can source from an external url or file (can be in any directory). -->
