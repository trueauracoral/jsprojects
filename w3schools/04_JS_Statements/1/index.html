<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by the computer.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<!-- Each line in this code is a "statement" which is run one by one. In order to seperate them we must use semicolons ";" -->
<script>
/* let will declare data in a variable which is only accessible inside of this block of code. The term for this is "block scope" */
let x, y, z;
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x * y;

/* They manuelly add up strings of text and the integer created as z in the example. I heavily prefer using f strings like this one. just ` around and then ${var}. Much cleaner. */
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = `The value of z is ${z}.`;
</script>
